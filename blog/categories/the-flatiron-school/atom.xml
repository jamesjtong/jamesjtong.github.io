    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, I am going to start blogging about my journey in learning web development and computer programming. This journey started a few months ago as I decided I wanted a career in which I was constantly learning and constantly building.</p>

<p>To achieve my goal, I started doing web tutorials at codecacademy, rubymonk, codeschool, teamtreehouse. Along the way, I also read a few books including Peter Cooper&rsquo;s Beginning Ruby, eloquentjavascript, Chris Pine&rsquo;s learn to program. (I will review each of these sources in-depth in a future post).</p>

<p>After some time self-studying, I read an article about programming bootcamps and how they were revolutionizing learning. Excited about the prospect of an intense &ldquo;bootcamp-like&rdquo; learning experience, I did a lot of research on the different schools and started applying to many. I ended up choosing the Flatiron School. In this blog, I will post about some of the cool things that I learn along the way.</p>

<p>If anyone has any questions regarding my posts or my experiences, feel free to email me at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;&#106;&#116;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x33;&#x33;&#x40;&#103;&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#x6a;&#x74;&#111;&#110;&#x67;&#51;&#x33;&#x40;&#x67;&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a></p>
